## Project Overview
This LabWindows/CVI application demonstrates **bidirectional RSâ€‘232 data exchange** using two **virtual COM ports (COM1â€¯â†”â€¯COM2)** bridged locally with *Virtual Serial Port Tools*.  
It supports three data modes and visualises the traffic live on a digital analyser panel.

---

## Key Features
* **String I/O** â€“ polling *or* interrupt driven, optional parity errorâ€‘correction toggle  
* **Numeric I/O** â€“ fullâ€‘duplex double precision numbers via receive interrupt  
* **Binary Image Transfer** â€“ chunked send/receive with dynamic bitmap reconstruction on a canvas  
* **Digital Bit Analyser** â€“ plots raw UART bits for string mode using `PlotDigitalLines`  
* **Configurable polling rate** (timer) and onâ€‘theâ€‘fly parity reâ€‘initialisation  
* **Thread pool + locks** for safe background polling and GUI responsiveness

## GUI Panels
| Panel | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| **COM1** | Main control: choose mode, enter data, load image, set polling & parity |
| **COM2** | Displays incoming data (string / numeric) or received image |
| **Analyzer** | Digital waveform of bits in *String* mode |

*(All panels are defined in **`EX8.uir`**.)*

---

## Communication Modes
| Mode | How it works |
|------|--------------|
| **String** | User types text â†’ `SendCallback` writes to COM1, reads echo from COM2 and plots bits. Optional **polling**: two threads periodically write/read both ports via a timer. |
| **Numeric** | Numeric control value formatted as ASCII, sent on COM1; COM2 receive interrupt updates display. |
| **Binary Image** | Selected bitmap is serialised and chunkâ€‘written. COM2 interrupt rebuilds the image and draws it on the canvas once complete. |

All modes rely on `initilizeComPorts()` which opens both ports at **9600â€¯Bd, 7E1/7O1/7N1** depending on the parity setting.

## Building & Running
### Prerequisites
* **LabWindows/CVIâ€¯2019 or newer**  
* **Virtual Serial Port Tools** (or any loopback hardware) â€“ create a bridge **COM1 â†” COM2**  
* Windows 10/11

### Steps
1. Clone or download this repository.  
2. Open **`EX8.prj`** or workspace **`EX8.cws`** in LabWindows/CVI.  
3. Ensure the bridged ports are named **COM1** and **COM2** or edit `def.h` â†’ `COM_PORT_1/2`.  
4. *Buildâ€¯â†’â€¯Run* (F5).  
5. Use *Menuâ€¯â†’â€¯Communicationâ€¯Type* to switch modes, then interact with the controls.

> **Shortcut:**  
> A preâ€‘built **EX8.exe** is included. If the LabWindows/CVI Runâ€‘Time Engine is installed, you can launch the GUI directly:
>
> ```bash
> cd path/to/CVI_RS232_Lab/bin   # folder containing EX8.exe
> EX8.exe
> ```
>
> Make sure your virtual bridge (COM1â€¯â†”â€¯COM2) is active, or update `def.h` and rebuild to match different port names.
